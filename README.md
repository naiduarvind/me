## Request for me to speak at your event

The best way to ask me to speak at your conference is to book a time [here](https://calendly.com/arvind-naidu/talk-by-arvind) and include the following information:

 - What is the name of the event?
 - What is the best link to find out more about the event?
 - What is your name and contact information?
 - What type of presentation you have in mind?
 - Are there any race tracks near the event? Skate park? Exotic cafes?
 - Anything else you want!
 
 These events go directly to a private account that I own. I receive push notifications, so I assure you - I will see this request. It might take me a while to get back to you, so please be patient.
